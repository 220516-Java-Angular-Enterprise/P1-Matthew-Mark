### Project Description

For the foundations module of your training you are tasked with building an API that 
will support a new internal expense reimbursement system. 
This system will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred 
while on company time. All registered employees in the company can login and submit 
requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. 
Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for 
all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny 
requests for expense reimbursement.
